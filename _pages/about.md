About me
------
Hi there! I’m an incoming PhD student at the University of Washington. I recently graduated from UCLA with a BS in Bioengineering. During my time there, I worked in the labs of [Sri Kosuri](http://www.kosurilab.org/) and [Tom Vallim](https://tarling-vallimlab.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/). Formerly, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, where I was advised by [Jishnu Das](https://www.immunology.pitt.edu/person/jishnu-das-phd) and [Galit Alter](https://www.ragoninstitute.org/portfolio-item/alter-lab/).

Research interests
------
My research interests are diverse, spanning over various fields including systems biology, single-cell genomics, machine learning, and infectious diseases.

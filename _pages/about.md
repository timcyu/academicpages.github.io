About me
------
Hi there! Iâ€™m an incoming PhD student at the University of Washington. I recently graduated from UCLA with a BS in Bioengineering. During my time there, I worked in the labs of [Sri Kosuri](http://www.kosurilab.org/) and [Tom Vallim](https://tarling-vallimlab.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/). Formerly, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, where I was advised by [Jishnu Das](https://www.immunology.pitt.edu/person/jishnu-das-phd) and [Galit Alter](https://www.ragoninstitute.org/portfolio-item/alter-lab/). I'm originally from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts but spent most of my teens living in Shanghai, China.

Research interests
------
My research interests are diverse, spanning over various fields including systems biology, single-cell genomics, machine learning, and infectious diseases. 

Previous work has been equivalently diverse. My projects have focused on employing massively parallel reporter assays to uncover new sequence-function relationships in *E. coli*, and applying supervised machine learning to 1) discover novel gene regulators of mammalian lipid metabolism, and 2) identify correlates of vaccine-mediated immunity to malaria.
